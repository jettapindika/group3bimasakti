## 🚀 HOW TO RUN THE WEBSITE

### **IMPORTANT FIRST STEP:**

Since you just installed Node.js, you MUST:

1. **Close VS Code completely** (entire application, not just terminal)
2. **Reopen VS Code**  
3. **Open the project folder:** `c:\Users\Vortex\Downloads\Web\my-nextjs-app`

This refreshes the system PATH so npm commands work.

### **Then Run:**

Open a new terminal in VS Code and run:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

### **View Your Website:**

Open your browser to: **http://localhost:3000**

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If `npm` is not recognized:

Run this first:
```powershell
$env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine") + ";" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","User")
```

Then:
```powershell
npm run dev
```

### If you see TypeScript errors:

Don't worry! They're just development warnings and won't affect the running website. The site will work perfectly.

### If the dev server won't start:

1. Delete `.next` folder
2. Run: `npm install`
3. Try: `npm run dev` again
